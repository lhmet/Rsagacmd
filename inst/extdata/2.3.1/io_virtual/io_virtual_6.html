Wichmann, LASERDATA GmbH (c) 2014</td></tr></table><hr><h4>Description</h4>The module allows one to remove the overlap from point cloud tiles created from a virtual point cloud dataset. The tiles must have been created with an overlap and a spcvf tile info file must have been outputted too. The latter describes the original bounding boxes of the tiles (i.e. without overlap) and is used by this module to remove the overlap.
A virtual point cloud dataset is a simple XML format with the file extension .spcvf, which can be created with the 'Create Virtual Point Cloud Dataset' module. Point cloud tiles with an overlap are usually created from such an virtual point cloud dataset with the 'Get Subset from Virtual Point Cloud' module.
