\title{List temporary files created by Rsagacmd}
\usage{
saga_show_tmpfiles()
}
\value{
returns the file names of the files in the temp directory that have been generated by
  Rsagacmd. Note this list of files only includes the primary file extension, i.e. '.shp' for a
  shapefile without the accessory files (e.g. .prj, .shx etc.).
}
\description{
For convenience, functions in the Rsagacmd package create temporary files if any outputs for a
SAGA-GIS tool are not specified as arguments. Temporary files in R are automatically removed at
the end of each session. However, when dealing with raster data, these temporary files
potentially can consume large amounts of disk space. These temporary files can be observed during
a session by using the saga_show_tmpfiles function, and can be removed using the
saga_remove_tmpfiles function.
