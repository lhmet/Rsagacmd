Description: Provides a fully functional approach of scripting with the open-source 'SAGA-GIS' (System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses Geographical Information System) software. Rsagacmd dynamically generates R functions for every 'SAGA-GIS' geoprocessing tool based on the user's currently installed 'SAGA-GIS' version. These functions are contained within an S3 object and are accessed as a named list of libraries and tools. This structure facilitates an easier scripting experience by organizing the large number of 'SAGA-GIS' geoprocessing tools (>700) by their respective library. Interactive scripting can therefore fully take advantage of code autocompletion tools (e.g. in 'Rstudio'), allowing for each tools syntax to be quickly recognized. Furthermore, the most common types of spatial data (via the 'raster', 'sp', and 'sf' packages) along with non-spatial data are seamlessly passed from R to the 'SAGA-GIS' command line tool for geoprocessing operations, and the results are automatically loaded as the appropriate R object. Outputs from individual 'SAGA-GIS' tools can also be chained using pipes from the 'magrittr' and 'dplyr' packages to chain complex geoprocessing operations together in a single statement.
